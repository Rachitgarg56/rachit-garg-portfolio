  const aboutMeContent = `Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Oktay and I'm from Berlin, Germany. As a
  Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually
  appealing websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic design
  isn't just a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I work on.
  Growing up bilingual, I developed a love for languages and I currently
  speak four of them fluently. I believe that this skill has given me a
  unique perspective and allows me to communicate effectively with clients
  from all over the world. One of my strengths is adding a personal touch
  to my projects by adding the client's identity and message into the
  design, creating meaningful and beautiful end products that are both
  eye-catching and user-friendly. In my free time, I enjoy exploring my
  other passions, such as photography and music production, which provide
  me with creative outlets. I am also very passionate about Web3 and
  everything related to crypto, NFTs and blockchain technology as I
  believe they have the potential to revolutionize business and online
  interactions. If you have an innovative idea for a project that needs to
  be developed, I would love to hear from you. Your vision can be turned
  into a real product. Don't hesitate to reach out and let's start a
  conversation about your concept. I'm excited to collaborate and help
  bring your ideas to life.`
